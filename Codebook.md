# Tidy Dataset

The name of the final tidy dataset associated with this codebook is final_tidy_dataset.txt

# Description

It has column names 1. Activity Id, 2. Volunteer Id and then followed by 66 variable columns corresponding to MEAN - mean() and STANDARD DEVIATION - std() calculations. The names are those contained in the features.txt file.

The first column of the final tidy dataset is of class factor.
The second column of the final tidy dataset is of class integer.
The remaining 66 columns are of class numeric.

In all, there are 180 rows and 68 columns. The dataset is grouped by activity id and then by volunteer id. Since, there are 6 activities and 30 volunteers. The total records are 180 in number. The 66 variables have the average values for each variable (by activity and volunteer grouping). The dataset is also sorted on the activity id column.

The activity id contains the names of eah activity: Laying, Standing, Sitting, Walking_Downstairs,
Walking_Upstairs and Walking. These are contained in activity_labels.txt

The columns have been given descriptive names.

1. The first column for activities is called Activity Id
2. The second colmn is called Volunteer Id (1 to 30)

The next 66 columns for variables corresponding to mean and std (Standard Deviation) are:
